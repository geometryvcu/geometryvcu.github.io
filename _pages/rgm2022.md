The Richmond Geometry Festival will focus on emergent research topics while bringing together specialists in two areas: low-dimensional topology and algebraic geometry. The 2022 edition follows the inaugural edition in summer 2021. The Richmond Geometry Festival adds research mathematics to the broad culture of festivals that are enjoyed in RVA on <a href='https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Frichmondjazzandmusicfestival.com%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw01pwmNrSsT-geZjEk1iasT'>jazz</a> and <a href='https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.richmondfolkfestival.org%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw2rjksRnz6zwl9ToR9CHDct'>folk music</a>, <a href='https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rvafilmfestival.com%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw2CWVbEc27Iy0hnj6jF6tQv'>films</a>, and <a href='https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.visitrichmondva.com%2Frestaurants%2Fevents%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw07c8c1Q18fiN11dr4kdStT'>food</a>.

<b>Poster Session</b>

The festival will feature a virtual poster session with the aim of showcasing research by early-career mathematicians. Titles and abstracts of accepted posters will appear below.

Everyone is encouraged to apply to present their work at the poster session. The <b>Graduate Best Poster Award</b> will be presented to the most accomplished poster presentation by a graduate student. The poster session application is an optional part of the registration and is still open.

<b>Congratulations to Shubham Sinha (UCSD)</b>, the winner of the Graduate Best Poster Award, for the poster titled 'Euler characteristics of tautological bundles over Quot scheme of curves.' 

A honorable mention goes to <b>Sally Collins (GA Tech)</b> for the poster titled 'The Mazur pattern, the figure eight knot, and smooth concordance.'
