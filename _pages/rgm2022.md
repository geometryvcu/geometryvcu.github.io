<br/>
The Richmond Geometry Meeting will focus on emergent research topics while bringing together researchers in algebraic geometry, low-dimensional topology, and mathematical physics. In summer 2023, we will highlight developments in moduli theory together with new perspectives in Floer homology and low-dimensional topology. This year's format will be in-person.

This meeting is supported by NSF award <a href='https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2240741'>DMS-2240741</a>
